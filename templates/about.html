    <h1>About Our Project</h1>

    <p>
        The AI Powered Loan Eligibility Prediction System is designed to assist users 
        in determining their loan eligibility instantly using machine learning models 
        and intelligent financial analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        This system analyzes various applicant factors such as income, credit history, 
        employment type, dependents, education background, and property location. 
        By processing these inputs, the model predicts whether a loan application is 
        likely to be approved by financial institutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
    <p>
        This project was created to demonstrate the practical implementation of 
        Artificial Intelligence in the domain of finance. It aims to simplify 
        decision-making for:
