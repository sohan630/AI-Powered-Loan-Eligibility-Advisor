## 🚀 Overview

**AI-Powered Loan Eligibility Advisor** is an intelligent machine learning-based system designed to predict an applicant’s loan approval eligibility using key financial and personal information — including income, credit history, education, employment status, and property area. The project leverages AI to assist banks and financial institutions in automating loan decisions with improved accuracy and fairness.

Built as part of my **AI Internship Project at Infosys Springboard**, this end-to-end solution combines a Flask web interface, a trained ML model, interactive chatbot guidance, and secure user authentication — delivering a complete, production-ready tool for real-world lending scenarios.
